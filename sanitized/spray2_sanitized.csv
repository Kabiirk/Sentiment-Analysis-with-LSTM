2,2020-06-04,This is to my dismay that Amazon being so vigilant has delivered me a package where both bottles didn't have any kind of protective seal so that none of the spray leaks. Next anyone having a basic sense would understand that the net weight/quantity was pretty less as compared to what it should posses. Lifebuoy should be much more aggressive while pricing the net amount is not worth the money. I recommend to look into other products. Not worth the price.,Dissatisfaction and disappointment,1

6,2020-06-18,"I was terribly disappointed to see little size of the bottle. Normally at time of ordering customer sees product pictures &amp; order assuming that qty will be comparable to other competitors. However, i feel like cheated by Lifebuoy by delivering a little bottle at the same price which its competitors are delivering double qty. Also the bottle does not have any seal inside. This means it could have been used by anyone earlier. Irony is that you cannot return this product after you receive it. Such a pity &amp; quite shameful. Will never buy or recommend it for anyone",Too little &amp; Very Costly,1
7,2020-06-06,first of all when v open d box one of d spray doesn't hv upper lid. the spray pressure z not very powerful. scent z ok. pri e z high. why a product should come to us without lid...what's d quality control???since v hv to use it urgently v r not returning...as it wld again tk 4/5 days. but be careful bfr dispatching any product to customer ...why compromise on quality n ur name..,sub standard item,2
8,2020-06-16,"Quantity is very less, there is no seal so we dont know if it's a fresh piece or used and opened one....savlon spray is a better buy as savlon has more quantity for the same price...not returning as I require it...but will not purchase it next time...dettol and savlon spray are better products than this so would preferably buy these next time",Not so much worth,1
9,2020-05-31,"Lifebuoy products have always been a hot favourite in our household, despite HLL having once been a competitor of my erstwhile company P&amp;G.I quite liked the germ spray, but if you're thinking that it will kill viruses you may want to think twice before picking one up.Carmelita FernandesFood &amp; Travel Writer",Germ but not Virus Spray,4
10,2020-07-23,"Quite a few reviews saying this is expensive than other surface disinfectant sprays like Savlon, Dettol, Dabur, Bodyguard but forgets to mention those are based on LPG/propellant with excipients. Nowhere on those products it is mentioned that you can use those on hands.Whereas this Lifebuoy Germ Kill spray is based on ENA (Extra Neutral Alcohol) which is a food grade alcohol of highest purity that you can find on alcoholic beverages.Coming to price for 75ml at â‚¹149 it surely is a lot expensive than other surface disinfectant sprays available but this is also a lot more compact, easy to fit in your bag when using outside. You don't need to carry another hand sanitizer since this can also be safely used on hands.I tried this to clean my mobile's tempered glass and to my surprise it didn't create a sticky rainbow mess which was an issue while using the gel based hand sanitizer from same brand.Another thing is that HUL is using different ingredients to make these hand sanitizers nowadays. Some are old perfumed gel based with ethyl alcohol but some are ENA based same as this product and those are available at 500ml bottles with same ingredients as this one at normal hand sanitizer price. But then it's also a lot of hassle to get that version, putting in a spray bottle whereas this is a lot easy to get and more compact, sturdy to use anywhere.Overall I quite liked the pleasant fragrance but they need to do something about the pricing.",An expensive spray that works as surface disinfectant but also can be used safely on hands!,4
11,2020-06-02,I received a damaged product today...paying such price for this defective product!not at all expected from Amazon!I'm highly disappointed...I want a replacement or a refund ASAP,Received damaged product,1
12,2020-09-04,"The best feature of this lifebuoy anti-germ spray is that it's safe on the hands as well as the usual hard/soft surfaces. It's ideal for people who remain outside for longer hours on daily basis like office staffs, hospital staffs, travellers..etc and a safe alternative to handwashes that need water. Got 2 for just 198 from Amazon.",Very safe hand spray  slightly_smiling_face ,5
13,2020-06-30,"This is my first bad experience from cloudtail. I generally avoid other sellers due to trust issues and past experiences. Anyway, this product was slightly damaged. Had a few dents. I had to buy 2 at once; cloudtail's policy; and I am okay with that. One bottle has a copper ring around the nozzle and other one had silver ring. I have uploaded the photographs. I am not sure if these were used products or damaged ones.For the good part  The scent is really good and pleasant. Using the spray is comfortable. Does not cause any irritation on the skin.If you don't want to use on skin, but only on surfaces, savlon is better and cheaper.",Recieved a damaged product from a decent seller,2

16,2020-07-27,"About the product This is the best sanitizer. Lifebuoy is a brand so you don't have to worry about the quality. It has very good fragrance, and does not at all smell clinical which causes a slight nauseous sensation in me. So I have used it more than twice. The fragrance lasts when used so you feel assured about the hygiene and sanitation. Consistency is thick, but it easily lasted more than a month for me. In the pandemic, I used many sanitizers, but this one beats them all. USe it for your skin or surface and feel safer with this.About the packaging The seal was broken. The bottle felt light as if used. Tried returning but since it is non-returnable, I was asked by AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE to discard and got the refund...GO FOR IT.",***GO FOR IT*** But DO CHECK for seal.,5
17,2020-06-02,One of them has not Cap.,Dishonest Seller,1
18,2020-06-19,"Okay so now after using it for a month , here are my views - i liked the product overall . The quantity is fine because if you are using it for daily use , where you need to sanitize your mobile phones , door bells and delivery packages , one bottle will last a month or so .The thing i like about this product compared to other products in the market is that if by mistake the liquid spills and touches your hand it is safe .My reccomendations for improvement to the brand - you have scope of improvement in the nozzle and spray area . One of the bottles that i have has a small of amount of liquid left but when i press the nozzle the liquid doesn't come out . so i feel you need to improve it .",Good,4
19,2020-06-09,Very bad.. Out of 2 bottle 1 is working.. Also not sealed. Very very bad. Not expected from cloudtail,Worst product and seller,1
20,2020-08-29,"The quantity is a lot less as compared to other disinfectant sprays available in the same price. The spray system is similar to that of a perfume bottle and not deodrants, i.e., you have to repeatedly press it for spraying on surfaces. The consistency is watery and took ~7minutes to completey dry. The smell is good but quite strong. Better to invest in other disinfectant sprays in the same amount. Moreover, due to no-return policy and min. order qty. being 2, it was a complete loss for me as I needed only 1 can but HAD TO order 2 and couldn't even return those even when they were damaged.",Not worth the money,1

26,2020-06-21,"Extremely inconvenient to use for SUCH A HIGH PRICE!!The spray mouth &amp; area is very small, hence you will have to keep spraying multiple times.
