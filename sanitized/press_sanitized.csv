15,2020-07-25,"A really good product.But they have changed the efficacy of the product by taking a steo down from the alcohol levels. First it used to come with about 93% content but now it has been redesigned with about 72%-73% content.No harm no foul but charging the same price for a product that has cut some corners well not a good practice.Anyways the product smells wonderful and it works as intended. But the pump action is somewhat worst in all the products I have tried.It keeps dripping on it's own without even pressing the nozzle. I don't know why, but it's the same in both the products that I have bought locally and from amazon. So if lifebouy is reading this, please sort this issue guys!",Good product with revised contents!,4
