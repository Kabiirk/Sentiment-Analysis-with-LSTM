1,2020-05-15,"It's a fantastic and genuine product with great quality. Always go for the genuine and old and trusted brands like Dettol Lifebuoy Dabur Boroplus etc and avoid newly mushroomed fake and unreliable brands like Floh, Mirah Belle etc. I've mentioned these two brands in particular because I've been cheated by them. Their sanitizers are of extremely low quality and hazardous.",Great product,5

3,2020-05-22,"I saw so many reviews and people are sayibg that is duplicate but let me clear your doubts its not at all duplicate its an original product by lifebuoyFirst of all there is a slight change in packaging as the cap is a air tight cap different from pre corona packaging, it is different just to prevent the alcohol content from any leakage or dryingSecondly its absolutely safe i have ordered the product and still using it regularly, see the thing is they have increased the composition of alcohol in the sanitizer for better protection from corona as it says it has 95% Ethyl so dont woery its absolutely safe abd change in smell is due to increased composition of ethyl in itAnd it even has batch no. Licence date of packaging and hall mark of hindustan unilever so don't panic its absolutely safe and brand life lifebuoy will never cheat, i repeat its absolutely safe and like any other sanitizer it has a cooling effect after applying to your hands thats a sign of alcohol content in it which makes it a pure and safe sanitizer  grinning_face ",This is not a duplicate sanitizer,5

39,2020-05-24,"I will sum up my review in following parts.1. Cap- The first thing I noticed before ordering is that many people received a bottle with different cap, so did I. The only reason I could think of is that company might have run out of red cap. Also checked with other customers on different websites and some of them have also received the product with different cap.2. Smell/Scent- The sanitizer has strawberry smell, which is different from the other lifebuoy sanitizer but it might be due to the fact that this sanitizer has different composition that the one we buy at our local shop.3. I checked for any tampering with the bottle but even the Cap has two seals, one at the top of the bottle which we will need to remove before using the sanitizer and the other at the bottom to remove the whole cap from the bottle this is visible in many photos submitted by other reviewers.4. The sanitizer is flammable so it does contain a good amount of alcohol.Overall I am satisfied with the product.

816,2020-05-25,"I don't understand why people are bothered that the cap is not red! The product contains the required amount of alcohol or not, that's what matters. and if u just take a drop between your fingers and rub it for a few seconds, it will rapidly evaporate, which ensures that it indeed contains a high amount of alcohol. I have compared it with Apollo life hand sanitizer (bought from Apollo pharmacy) which contains 60% alcohol, and this one indeed evaporates much faster than that. And as for the cap, it comes with a high quality seal-able cap! the red cap which is shown in the picture is not seal-able and might cause spillage during shipping. it has a nice blue gasket around the dispensing hole which forms a tight seal when closed.",Very nice,5

818,2020-06-16,"Lifebuoy is one of the best brand I have been using it's products from my childhood So I bought Lifebuoy hand sanitizer. It's really a good product as it is alcohol based and kills 99.9% germs keeping us safe It contains 95% ethile alcohol and this sanitizer is gel based. One of the most important thing is that it's consistency is thicker than others. I got a dispenser type bottle in seal pack condition. I am extremely satisfied as it's lifebuoy product and did justice to the brand name. It is easy to use, just take little amount of sanitizer on your palm, spread and rub over back of hands until dry. It protects us for longer time. Worth the money and highly recommended product in current situation.",Best sanitizer value for money,5
819,2020-06-23,"10 hrs immunity ones you rub on your hands unless you wash, as gurateed in description, which I found very useful. 2nd best thing is it's gel type sanitizer with very pleasant smell, few people complain about new fragrance it's due to High Alcohol content than previous one, it's cap is different from description but it's very airtight.
