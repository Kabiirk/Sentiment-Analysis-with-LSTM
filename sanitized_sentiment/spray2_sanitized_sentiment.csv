2,2,2020-06-04,This is to my dismay that Amazon being so vigilant has delivered me a package where both bottles didn't have any kind of protective seal so that none of the spray leaks.

10,10,2020-07-23,"Quite a few reviews saying this is expensive than other surface disinfectant sprays like Savlon, Dettol, Dabur, Bodyguard but forgets to mention those are based on LPG/propellant with excipients. Nowhere on those products it is mentioned that you can use those on hands.Whereas this Lifebuoy Germ Kill spray is based on ENA (Extra Neutral Alcohol) which is a food grade alcohol of highest purity that you can find on alcoholic beverages.Coming to price for 75ml at â‚¹149 it surely is a lot expensive than other surface disinfectant sprays available but this is also a lot more compact, easy to fit in your bag when using outside. You don't need to carry another hand sanitizer since this can also be safely used on hands.I tried this to clean my mobile's tempered glass and to my surprise it didn't create a sticky rainbow mess which was an issue while using the gel based hand sanitizer from same brand.Another thing is that HUL is using different ingredients to make these hand sanitizers nowadays. Some are old perfumed gel based with ethyl alcohol but some are ENA based same as this product and those are available at 500ml bottles with same ingredients as this one at normal hand sanitizer price. But then it's also a lot of hassle to get that version, putting in a spray bottle whereas this is a lot easy to get and more compact, sturdy to use anywhere.Overall I quite liked the pleasant fragrance but they need to do something about the pricing.",An expensive spray that works as surface disinfectant but also can be used safely on hands!,4,0.184,0.041,0.775,0.9923,Positive
