5,2020-06-04,This is to my dismay that Amazon being so vigilant has delivered me a package where both bottles didn't have any kind of protective seal so that none of the spray leaks. Next anyone having a basic sense would understand that the net weight/quantity was pretty less as compared to what it should posses. Lifebuoy should be much more aggressive while pricing the net amount is not worth the money. I recommend to look into other products. Not worth the price.,Dissatisfaction and disappointment,1
6,2020-05-24,Very expensive.. compared to competition...,Very expensive for size,1
7,2020-06-18,"I was terribly disappointed to see little size of the bottle. Normally at time of ordering customer sees product pictures &amp; order assuming that qty will be comparable to other competitors. However, i feel like cheated by Lifebuoy by delivering a little bottle at the same price which its competitors are delivering double qty. Also the bottle does not have any seal inside. This means it could have been used by anyone earlier. Irony is that you cannot return this product after you receive it. Such a pity &amp; quite shameful. Will never buy or recommend it for anyone",Too little &amp; Very Costly,1
8,2020-06-06,first of all when v open d box one of d spray doesn't hv upper lid. the spray pressure z not very powerful. scent z ok. pri e z high. why a product should come to us without lid...what's d quality control???since v hv to use it urgently v r not returning...as it wld again tk 4/5 days. but be careful bfr dispatching any product to customer ...why compromise on quality n ur name..,sub standard item,2
9,2020-06-16,"Quantity is very less, there is no seal so we dont know if it's a fresh piece or used and opened one....savlon spray is a better buy as savlon has more quantity for the same price...not returning as I require it...but will not purchase it next time...dettol and savlon spray are better products than this so would preferably buy these next time",Not so much worth,1
10,2020-05-31,"Lifebuoy products have always been a hot favourite in our household, despite HLL having once been a competitor of my erstwhile company P&amp;G.I quite liked the germ spray, but if you're thinking that it will kill viruses you may want to think twice before picking one up.Carmelita FernandesFood &amp; Travel Writer",Germ but not Virus Spray,4
11,2020-07-23,"Quite a few reviews saying this is expensive than other surface disinfectant sprays like Savlon, Dettol, Dabur, Bodyguard but forgets to mention those are based on LPG/propellant with excipients. Nowhere on those products it is mentioned that you can use those on hands.Whereas this Lifebuoy Germ Kill spray is based on ENA (Extra Neutral Alcohol) which is a food grade alcohol of highest purity that you can find on alcoholic beverages.Coming to price for 75ml at ₹149 it surely is a lot expensive than other surface disinfectant sprays available but this is also a lot more compact, easy to fit in your bag when using outside. You don't need to carry another hand sanitizer since this can also be safely used on hands.I tried this to clean my mobile's tempered glass and to my surprise it didn't create a sticky rainbow mess which was an issue while using the gel based hand sanitizer from same brand.Another thing is that HUL is using different ingredients to make these hand sanitizers nowadays. Some are old perfumed gel based with ethyl alcohol but some are ENA based same as this product and those are available at 500ml bottles with same ingredients as this one at normal hand sanitizer price. But then it's also a lot of hassle to get that version, putting in a spray bottle whereas this is a lot easy to get and more compact, sturdy to use anywhere.Overall I quite liked the pleasant fragrance but they need to do something about the pricing.",An expensive spray that works as surface disinfectant but also can be used safely on hands!,4
12,2020-06-02,I received a damaged product today...paying such price for this defective product!not at all expected from Amazon!I'm highly disappointed...I want a replacement or a refund ASAP,Received damaged product,1
13,2020-05-23,Not value for money.I always get damaged bottle.Savlon Surface Disinfectant Spray 170 g is the best.,I always get damaged bottle. Not value for money.,1
14,2020-06-02,One of them has not Cap.,Dishonest Seller,1
15,2020-07-27,"About the product This is the best sanitizer. Lifebuoy is a brand so you don't have to worry about the quality. It has very good fragrance, and does not at all smell clinical which causes a slight nauseous sensation in me. So I have used it more than twice. The fragrance lasts when used so you feel assured about the hygiene and sanitation. Consistency is thick, but it easily lasted more than a month for me. In the pandemic, I used many sanitizers, but this one beats them all. USe it for your skin or surface and feel safer with this.About the packaging The seal was broken. The bottle felt light as if used. Tried returning but since it is non-returnable, I was asked by AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE to discard and got the refund...GO FOR IT.",***GO FOR IT*** But DO CHECK for seal.,5
16,2020-06-19,"Okay so now after using it for a month , here are my views - i liked the product overall . The quantity is fine because if you are using it for daily use , where you need to sanitize your mobile phones , door bells and delivery packages , one bottle will last a month or so .The thing i like about this product compared to other products in the market is that if by mistake the liquid spills and touches your hand it is safe .My reccomendations for improvement to the brand - you have scope of improvement in the nozzle and spray area . One of the bottles that i have has a small of amount of liquid left but when i press the nozzle the liquid doesn't come out . so i feel you need to improve it .",Good,4
17,2020-06-09,Very bad.. Out of 2 bottle 1 is working.. Also not sealed. Very very bad. Not expected from cloudtail,Worst product and seller,1
18,2020-06-30,"This is my first bad experience from cloudtail. I generally avoid other sellers due to trust issues and past experiences. Anyway, this product was slightly damaged. Had a few dents. I had to buy 2 at once; cloudtail's policy; and I am okay with that. One bottle has a copper ring around the nozzle and other one had silver ring. I have uploaded the photographs. I am not sure if these were used products or damaged ones.For the good part  The scent is really good and pleasant. Using the spray is comfortable. Does not cause any irritation on the skin.If you don't want to use on skin, but only on surfaces, savlon is better and cheaper.",Recieved a damaged product from a decent seller,2
19,2020-05-27,"This LIFEBUOY Antibacterial Germ Kill Spray is LIFE SAVIOUR. It's very handy and best for travelling. This spray is very nice to use during this time whether it be your doors, doorbell, groceries, and other stuffs too.. Really helped us to keep everything germ free in this Scary times..This is a must have product in this situation..Thanks for Amazon for keeping this in stock..","Trustworthy brand , amazing product",5
20,2020-08-29,"The quantity is a lot less as compared to other disinfectant sprays available in the same price. The spray system is similar to that of a perfume bottle and not deodrants, i.e., you have to repeatedly press it for spraying on surfaces. The consistency is watery and took ~7minutes to completey dry. The smell is good but quite strong. Better to invest in other disinfectant sprays in the same amount. Moreover, due to no-return policy and min. order qty. being 2, it was a complete loss for me as I needed only 1 can but HAD TO order 2 and couldn't even return those even when they were damaged.",Not worth the money,1

23,2020-06-17,"The items just came in a amazon cover and one of them had a big dent on it. The spray caps are different for each of the items and one of them weigh less and the most pathetic thing is that there was a leakage. Not worth the money spent on this item, rather better wud have got a savlon spray.This is supposed to be a disinfectant or germ kill spray as per product description however feedback is asked on scent, is that supposed to be funny?Is this a genuine product from Lifebuoy????",Not up the standard - is this genuine prod????,1
24,2020-06-21,"Extremely inconvenient to use for SUCH A HIGH PRICE!!The spray mouth &amp; area is very small, hence you will have to keep spraying multiple times. The spray doesn't work also several times; so one will have to keep shaking, try holding the bottle at different angles to see if that works, keep pressing it &amp; even then it doesn't work at times. So if you disinfecting a large area, your hand will start aching after sometime due to all the shaking of the bottle &amp; pressing of the nozzle.",The spray doesn't work very well,3
25,2020-06-21,I don't know how much does this sanitizer spray kills germs. But it smells amazing. I bought this spray to spray it on my courier package what comes from outside.It is very easy to use as well. I got this in the retail price.,Easy to use.. thumbs_up ,5

28,2020-06-03,"Pungent smell says it is good sanitizer. Sprayer is not up to the mark , some amount is trickling if not properly operated , very small quantity for that cost , and some amount of liquid already dribbling when I first opened the lid . Is it because of package or somebody already used ?",Product wise it is good,4

30,2020-08-07,"I purchased this sanitising spray due to the brand value. Quality is really good and it sprays fine mist. However, it’s bit costly if you use regularly. I purchased two units but it lasted only for 1 month. Go for it if price is not an issue for you as quality is quite better.",Easy to use but a bit costly,4
31,2020-08-12,The price is very comparing to other surface disinfectant online. Dont know why lifebuoy sells like this. And the quantity is very little. Not satisfied with that,Price high,3
32,2020-08-16,"Product is good. But I am sure it was tampered. Caps were open. One bollte has very less quantity than another; one can easily detect that.I am noticing, the same thing happens with face wash and shampoo as well. It's better to buy such things from local shops.",Tampered,1
33,2020-06-24,Lifebuoy antibacterial germ kill spray is very handy because of slim bottle. We can spray on anthing to sanitise. As lifebuoy is well known brand scent is also mild.

34,2020-06-22,"Except for the packaging, that wasn't proper since it had leaked a little, the rest is good.The bottle is slim and is easy to carry. We use it spray door knobs, packets, and even on our hands.The scent is like lifebuoy soap and disappears in a while.",Great product.,5
35,2020-06-13,Ordered this sanitizer spray as we need to keep everything sanitized and protected in this bad situation where everyone is getting infected with the problem. This spray is okay and can be taken if nothing else you can find. Only one thing good about this spray is that it’s branded so I believe that it does it work well. Else the spray bottle is small but handy to use. Over decent spray to get and to sanitize everything around.,Sanitizer spray,4
36,2020-07-21,"The time are so critical that we have used all sorts of disinfectants and sprays... i have recently started going to office, i have used both of these products....the Lifebuoy spray doesn't evaporate after spraying... on my laptop it has left spray marks after continuous use for 2 days.. it says safe on skin... but i will seriously recommend you guys not to do that as it leaves the skin super dry and chapped... on the contrary this Disinfectant by rahosafe has very mild smell.. when i use it in my car.. it causes no suffocation and evaporates super fast leaving zero mark..... this also is not ideal for skin.. but they don't claim it ..so its okay...",Smell is poor...The nozel is not of good in quality..,1

38,2020-07-23,"Product is good but I’m giving 2 stars because of the condition in which can was received from amazon, firstly there was no cAp for both the cans and they were dented and squeezed from almost every where and looked very old not expected from amazon",No cap received and dented cans,2
39,2020-06-13,"Price is little high but ingredients are good , scent is also good , 70% neutral alcohol whereas in this price point Savlon is giving double but that is ethanol(not safe on hands) whereas it has alcohol (safe on hands)Its pocket friendly also we can keep it in our pocket.",Good one with neutral alcohol.,5
40,2020-07-15,"Received a used and damaged product. Received one without a spray head and the one with the spray head has already been used. Packaging was bad. Also the spray leaves a weird odour behind. And like they suggest us not to wipe, we’ll have to wipe it because after we spray and leave it out to dry the surface, it gets sticky. So if you’ve come here to buy this product thinking sanitising a surface is easy with this, you’re wrong. You might as well try buying the Dettol disinfectant spray. This one doesn’t have a good coverage of surface, takes a lot of time to dry and we have to wipe it.",DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY.,1

49,2020-06-29,Although lifebuoy is a good quality surface sanitizer I find this spray to be expensive. Rs.149 for just 75ml is too much.
